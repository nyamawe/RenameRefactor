# RenameRefactor 
An approach that identifies rename refactoring opportunities when implementing feature requests. The approach employs textual similarity to assess the similarity between a feature request description and implementing source code identiers' signature. The similarity threshold is set to determine whether identifiers signature would need renaming or not.
